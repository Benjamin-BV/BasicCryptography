# BasicCryptography
A (very) basic cipher algorithm I created, mostly for fun 
DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANY SOFTWARE AS IT IS NOT A SECURE ENCRYPTION METHOD, use SHA-2 family, or RSA encryption methods instead.
There is a challenge involved, where you are given an encrypted flag, and are prompted to use the given algorithm to decrypt the string to get an output
For this challenge, you may also have to use a pen and paper to keep track of some things :)
